The assembly first moves either up->e1.y or up->e2.next %rax. Since %rax is dereferenced in the
next line, inside %rax must have been up->e2.next. %rdx changes to the value of *(up->e2.next). Since
%rdx is dereferenced in the next line, %rdx must have been the value *(up->e2.next).e1.p. 
%rdx is set to the value of *(*(up->e2.next).e1.p). In the next line, 8(%rax) is subtracted
from %rdx. Since 8(%rax) must represent a long, that number is *(up->e2.next).e1.y. %rdi is
still up so (%rdi) is (up->e2.x). 

The final c code for the line to replace must therefore be:

up->e2.x = *(*(up->e2.next).e1.p) - *(up->e2.next).e1.y
